# Welcome to the Luxoft Interview!

As it will be probably described by the interviewer, you have to complete an excercise for the technical evaluation. Since time is limited, its probably that you wont have enough time to complete the excercise, dont worry about this. Whats more important is the quality of the code, so we will provide you some more info below. Relax and continue :)

## Description 

We have a simple "To Do" app that is in **WIP**. Right now, the project is a little messy (with no architecture or good practices implemented). So we would like you to implement a new functionality and improve the current implementation using the best practices.

The Minimum Viable Product for us to be able to add a new **to do** item and update the table.

# Points of Interests

We are interested more in the quality of the code rather than completing the excercise, but you should still try to achieve to complete it.

- Architecture.
- Design patterns.
- Overall code reusability.
- Problem solving skills.
- Communication (We will leave 10 minutes before the end of the interview to make some questions about your solution and approach to the problem). 

## To do in the excercise

- Implement the cell configuration with the array provided. 
- Implement the create to do screen and functionality (only add a textField and create button, for the date fields, use the current date).
- Implement the update logic (so the Home screen shows the newly created item).
- Make sure the unit tests are working.

### Extra points

- Implement the two empty tests defined in **HomeTests.swift**
- Improve the **BusinessLogicObject** in HomeViewController
- Handle errors and loading layer (display a loading view to know when we are waiting for the API response)

### A few extra notes

- Remember that the quality of the code/solution is more important than completing the excercise.
- Its valid to google things or use Xcode documentation.
- If you get stuck in something, try to continue with the other **To do** points.
- The API info is in the **API.swift** file.
- Feel free the reorganize the current project folder and files organization to suit your style or architecture.
