# Welcome to the Luxoft Interview!

As it will be probably described by the interviewer, you have to complete an excercise for the technical evaluation. Since time is limited, its probably that you wont have enough time to complete the excercise, dont worry about this. Whats more important is the quality of the code, so we will provide you some more info below. Relax and continue :)

# Points of Interests

As mentioned above, we are interested more in the quality of the code rather than completing the excercise, but you should still try to achieve to complete it.

- Architecture.
- Design patterns.
- Overall code reusability.
- Problem solving skills.
- Documentation.
- Communication (We will leave 10 minutes before the end of the interview to make some questions about your solution and approach to the problem). 


## Description 

We have a todo app that is in **WIP**, the person who started it, left the company and he only placed a few files in the project. Right now, after some time we noticed that the app has a crash, so its extremely important to fix it to know how much the app can do. 

The Minimum Viable Product for us is to be able to see all the todo items, with their respective "Complete" status and being able to add new todo items.

## To do in the project
- Fix the crash.
- Fetch the Todo items from an API (provided in the project) and parse them.
- Implement the create todo item screen and functionality.
- Implement the update logic (so the Home screen shows the newly created item).
- Make sure the unit tests are working.

### Extra points

- Implement the two empty tests defined in **HomeTests.swift**
- Improve the **BusinessLogicObject** in HomeViewController
- Use **Codable/Decodable** protocol to parse the items from the API.

### A few extra notes

- Remember that the quality of the code/solution is more important than completing the excercise.
- Its valid to google things or use Xcode documentation.
- If you get stuck in something, try to continue with the other **To do** points.
- The API info is in the **API.swift** file.
- Feel free the reorganize the current project folder and files organization to suit your style or architecture.
